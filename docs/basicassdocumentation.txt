what is this document?
    This is the basic ass documentation. Not a documentation about ass, but as in a slang to
    very very basic, therefore, basic ass documentation.

    1. stateofthecode
        This is a devlog of some kind to display in most detail how the code came to be
        and the research involved in it. This piece has no orderly fashion; expect major 
        cursing and cussing. This is how i cope with my Phantom Oscar Sierra code.

        Description of the code design 
    3. functioning
        Explanations on how most of the stuff works and its systems and subsystems
    4. usage
        How the program and its parts should be used to get what you expect.

    2.1 Lexical Analysis
        It goes as this series of loosely structured steps:
            1. Find all the possible token words available in the code and assemble a list with all the words
                to be passed to Analysis
            2. Analyze:
                2.1 first things -> commentaries are a pain in the bloody ass to do anything with.
                    We should take care of them first -> identify and remove them from the list. Add them to 
                    the number of commentaries found.
                2.2 Next is the easy part -> Tokenize and return the number of entities found. It should at the very least
                do this for now, but later we expect it to actually tokenize it for the Synthatical analyzer later. 
                    The expected classes are:

            
3. FUNCTIONING 
4. USAGE 
    4.1. Requirements
        This program should require python installed. To do so, use a search engine 
        to find the official python site and install python on your machine. 
    4.2 Basic usage
        After cloning the project, open the src folder and run as such:
            python main.py <path-to-your-pascal-code.pas>
        main.py serves no other purpose.
    4.3 Lexical analyzer
        4.3.1 Basics 
            It is a simple tokenizer. It does nothing ultimately useful. 
        4.3.2 Flags
            There is a flag there called debug, which runs a battery of tests
            Otherwise, to activate debug of all other functions, go inside the file and change 
            the debug variable to 1
            This should fill your terminal with tasteful prints

5. Glossary of Nato Phonetic Alphabet cursing
    5.1 purpose
        This is simply so the comment reader may understand what exactly im trying to 
        mean when I say something in the lines of Echo Sierra Alpha Delta or Phantom Oscar Sierra.

    5.2 The alphabet
        Beware papa was altered to phantom because ain't no way i'm cursing using papa. Other alterations 
        might be done, but the most outstanding is specially papa -> phantom

        BETA INDIA OSCAR SIERRA
            Bios or Bicho ignorante operando um sistema.
            This one is usually applied to me, i do believe.
        MIKE FOXTROT UNIFORM
            Major fuckup. MIKE might be also swaped for ROMEO for 
            a major fuckup. 
        BETA ALPHA
            Bitch ass. Simple as.
