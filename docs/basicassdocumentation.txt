    4.1. Requirements
        This program should require python installed. To do so, use a search engine 
        to find the official python site and install python on your machine. 
    4.2 Basic usage
        After cloning the project, open the src folder and run as such:
            python main.py <path-to-your-pascal-code.pas>
        main.py serves no other purpose.
